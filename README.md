Logitech no good no more, but it was once.

The Logitech K270 wireless keyboard was released in April 26, 2011. It was my first logitech product and it may have been one of its best. I remember being shocked when I spilled a whole glass of water on it and it somehow survived. Since then, Logitech has lost its vision - the vision of making cheap, functional devices that can take a beating or two and last for YEARS on a couple of AAA batteries.

Case in point: the Logitech Unifying Software. I am convinced that Logitech is now intentionally removing the existence of one of its greatest pieces of software to lure people into the Logi Bolt "ecosystem". They use shady language and trick you into installing Logi Bolt (see screenshots). I adeptly dodged these attempts because I knew Logi Bolt was gonna be bad news before I even installed it. You know how? The top rated 
post on this subreddit (https://redd.it/pk8ikv). So yeah. I'd say that Logitech just might have have lost its vision since the glory days of years past (m570 trackball, etc).
